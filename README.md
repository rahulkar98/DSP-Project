### Main Stages of the Project

This project mainly has three main parts 1.Feature Extraction 2.Feature Selection 3.Classification

###GOAL

To detect accidents using informative features extracted from noisy speed observations. 

We have access to two sources of real-data provided by the California Department of Transportation and California Highway Patrol:
 
 
 ###Speed Data:  Sensors are located approximately every 0.5 miles along the freeway in both North and South directions. For a given sensor, a speed reading is provided for each 5 minutes everyday, and includes details such as sensor location, time and date of the speed reading, and freeway direction.
 
 
 ###Accident Data:  Accidents details include the start time of the accident, duration of the accident, a brief description of the accident type, and the accident location in terms of absolute post mile.
